                    By bridging the opportunity gap, we help individuals move to and through 
                    the college process and career selection; thus, resulting in an increase

                            The idea of FlairNow came about when Claudia Saavedra was 16 years old. 
                            As an immigrant, coming from a low-income household and the first in her 
                            family to go to college, she had a difficult time understanding what was 
                            needed to enroll in college what steps she needed to do to receive a full-time 
                            job after college.  When she found out about her immigration status in the 
                            United States during the beginning of her senior year of high school, she 
                            realized that she could not apply to many opportunities and it took hours of 
                            research to find what she did qualify for.
                        </p>
                        <p class="py-2">
                            FlairNow started with a series of workshops created by Claudia during her lunch 
                            period in high school where she provided a step by step process to apply to college 
                            based on the hours of research she conducted.
                        </p>
                        <p class="py-2">
                            The idea further progressed when she attended Rutgers University to the creation of an 
                            online mentoring platform with in-person workshops. Here she was able to reach 400+ 
                            students nationally and internationally. She focused on college and career mentoring as 
                            well as social-emotional building.
                        </p>
                        <p class="py-2">
                            She met her co-founder Jose Dominguez when they spoke on a panel to help underrepresented 
                            students enroll in college and teamed up to build an application that matches individuals 
                            to opportunities based on their profile.
