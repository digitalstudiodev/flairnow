                                        Opportunities are beneficial because they help develop students' professional aptitude, 
                                        strengthen personal character, and provide a greater door to opportunity. 
                                        By investing in this, students' give themselves the broadest spectrum of opportunity 
                                        when seeking and applying for a job after high school and college.
                                    </p>

                                        With this in mind, Flair Now aims to match students with opportunities that are designed to bridge the opportunity gap. 
                                        By making sure our partner organizations are providing what is valuable to our target users, we can ensure we continue to 
                                        forfill our mission to better help the user through their educational career and assist them in climbing the social-economic ladder.

                                        An internship, paid or unpaid, has a purpose to give students industry experience. Unpaid internships are common 
                                        within companies, however, an unpaid internship is, for the most part, closed off to anyone who needs to actually be making money. 
                                        This means that most students doing unpaid internships are well-off enough to afford them, canceling out a whole section of people that fall 
                                        below a certain social-economic status, and contribute to the systematic discrimination of minorities, making unpaid internships an inequitable practice. 
                                        We strongly suggest that our partner organizations provide paid interships, although not a requirement, students are more inclined to apply to opportunities that are paid.

                                        Undocumented students are among the most resilient and diligent students in the country. As an undocumented student, you 
                                        may face legal and financial struggles that may 
                                        make it difficult to access career-related opportunities. At times it may feel like people do not 
                                        understand their situation and are unable to help them obtain the pre-professional resources that they 
                                        qualify for and need to advance your careers. As an undocumented student, they may be wondering “What do I qualify for?”
                                        While there are some limitations to accessing certain resources and opportunities,
                                        there are a growing number of internships, fellowships, scholarships, and graduate
                                        schools opening up their admission to undocumented students. We aim to assist students to identify opportunities that may spark interests 
                                        and help prepare them to apply. We strongly suggest our partner organizations to be open to provide for this group of our target users.
