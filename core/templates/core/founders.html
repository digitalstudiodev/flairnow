                            Claudia Saavedra is an immigrant from Chile and a first-generation college student. 
                            Despite circumstances, she received 1M dollars in scholarships to fund her education. 
                            As an undergraduate student, she attended Rutgers University.  In college, she traveled 
                            to 20 states- some states 2-3 times all expenses paid. Currently, she is studying her 
                            Masters in Public Administration at Rutgers University.  When she is not working, she
